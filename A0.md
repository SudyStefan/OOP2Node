# Assignment Overview

A0 provides the base of the project. The following assignments will build up on it, so it is in your best interest to correctly implement each aspect of A0.

### Basic Concept

In *Assignment A0*, you will implement a RESTful API using the Spring Boot REST framework to build a simple, versatile mapping service. This service will be able to respond to requests related to road layouts, points of interest (amenities). You are **not** required to use the MVC pattern for this assignment, but you should understand how to structure and handle API requests effectively and check for errors.

In future assignments (A1/A2), you will extend this functionality by incorporating data parsing and retrieval through gRPC, a protocol for communication between services. However, for A0, the focus is solely on setting up the REST API and returning hardcoded data as placeholders.

### RESTful API Overview

A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) allows you to expose resources (like roads, points of interest, or tiles in this case) via endpoints. Each resource can be accessed or manipulated using standard HTTP methods like:

    GET to retrieve resources,
    POST to create new resources,
    PUT to update resources,
    DELETE to remove resources.

In A0, you will implement several **GET** requests that respond with data representing roads and amenities. These requests should follow REST principles, meaning they are stateless, and each URL (endpoint) represents a specific resource.

### Spring Boot REST Framework Overview

Spring Boot is a Java-based framework that simplifies the creation of production-ready applications. The Spring Boot REST framework provides an easy way to build RESTful services. With it, you can quickly set up an API, define endpoints, and handle requests and responses.

In A0, you will use Spring Boot to:

   - Create a set of REST endpoints for handling requests related to amenities and roads.
   - Implement error handling for missing or invalid parameters.
   - Return placeholder data for amenities and roads as JSON responses. **(NOT HARDCODED STRINGS!)**

### Middleware and Backend Communication (Future Assignments)

While you will focus on setting up the REST API in A0, future assignments (A1/A2) will require you to connect this API to a backend that retrieves real data. In those tasks, you will implement gRPC communication between the middleware and backend, allowing the middleware to request actual map and geospatial data stored in the backend.

## Architecture

The project consists of three main components: the frontend, middleware, and backend. Each layer has a distinct role in the application's functionality, ensuring a smooth flow of data between the user and the system. Below is a breakdown of these components.The architecture of the project consists of the following parts:

![image.png](samples/architecture.png)

### Frontend

*Purpose:* The frontend is the user-facing part of the application, already provided to you.
*Technology:* It is written in HTML.
*Role:* 
- This is where users interact with the service.
- Gathers inputs from the user, such as map coordinates or routing requests, and sends them to the middleware.
- The frontend also displays the results returned by the system and in later assignments you will also see an interactive map of the data.

### Middleware

*Purpose:* Acts as the bridge between the frontend and backend.
*Technology:* Implemented using Java Spring (Spring Boot).
*Role:*
- **Request Processing**: When the frontend sends a request (e.g., for route calculation or fetching map data), the middleware processes it.
- **Validation and Error Handling**: Ensures the request is valid, and if not, generates appropriate error messages.
- **Data Preparation**: Can perform additional processing on the data (e.g., filtering, transforming) before forwarding it to the backend.

The middleware simplifies communication between the frontend and backend by handling complex tasks like input validation, and ensuring that requests are appropriately routed.

### Backend

*Purpose:* Core data processing layer.
*Technology:* Also implemented using Java.
*Role:*

- This is where the actual map data (roads, amenities, land usage) is stored and managed.
- The backend receives requests from the middleware, processes them (e.g., querying, calculating routes), and sends back the correct data to the middleware for user display. Also the backend is a server implemented using Java Classes.  

In the backend the core processing occurs. It interacts directly with the given dataset and saves the described objects.  
Here the requests from the middleware are being received, handled and the correct data is sent back to the middleware.

### Communication Between Middleware and Backend

- **Protocol:** gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) will be used to enable efficient communication between the middleware and backend.
- **Implementation:** In Assignment `A1`, you will implement gRPC to allow the middleware to forward requests to the backend, receive responses, and send them back to the frontend.
- **Purpose:** gRPC is chosen for its performance and ease of use in connecting the middleware and backend over the network, ensuring that large datasets like those from OpenStreetMap can be processed effectively.

## Dataset
*Data Source:* The project uses a filtered subset of OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. (can be found in the Teach Center)
*Format:* The dataset is in XML format, with unnecessary entries filtered out to focus on the roads, amenities, and land usage within Graz and surrounding areas.
*Processing:*
- You'll interact with this dataset primarily in the backend.
- Parsing OSM data can be complex, but youâ€™re provided with the [JTS](https://github.com/locationtech/jts/tree/master) (Java Topology Suite), a popular geospatial library in Java. We highly recommend using it to handle the geometric and spatial data efficiently.

In `A1` this will be one of the main tasks and further notes can be found there.


# Tasks

## Environment Argument Handling (5P)

This task involves handling environment variables for both the middleware and the backend services. You must ensure these variables are loaded, parsed, stored, and used appropriately, with proper logging. If any variables are missing or invalid, you should revert them to their default values. Here's a detailed breakdown of what is required:

#### Middleware Configuration
implement in `MapApplication.java`

1. `JMAP_MIDDLEWARE_PORT`
   + **Purpose:** Specifies the port number for the middleware's RESTful API.
   + **Requirement:** Convert this value to an integer and log it correctly. If the environment variable is not set or is invalid (e.g., not an integer, or outside the valid range of ports), you must revert to the default value.
   + **Default:** `8010`
2. `JMAP_BACKEND_TARGET`
   + **Purpose:** Defines the address:port combination of the backend service that the middleware should connect to.
   + **Requirement:** Accept this value as-is (no parsing required), but still log it correctly. If this variable is not set, you must revert to the default value.
   + **Default:** `localhost:8020`

#### Backend Configuration
implement in `MapServiceServer.java`

1. `JMAP_BACKEND_PORT`
   + **Purpose:** Specifies the port number for the backend service.
   + **Requirement:** Convert this value to an integer and log it correctly. If the environment variable is not set or is invalid, you must revert to the default value.
   + **Default:** `8020`
2. `JMAP_BACKEND_OSMFILE`
   + **Purpose:** Indicates the file path for loading OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, which the backend will use.
   + **Requirement:** Accept this value as-is and log it. If the file does not exist at the specified path, your backend service is allowed to stop. If the environment variable is not set, you must revert to the default value.
   + **Default:** `data/styria_reduced.osm`

## Requests

For `A0` you will implement only the middleware part of these requests because the connection to the dataset is not yet set up. You will need to implement the request for 5 amenities and 5 roads as outlined in [A0_ENTITIES](samples/A0_ENTITIES.md) and [A0_RESPONSES](samples/A0_RESPONSES.md). With these classes you store the specific infromation of a amenitie/road etc.

After you have created the class structures of roads and amenities you have to make instances of the [A0_ENTITIES](samples/A0_ENTITIES.md) and return them as a JSON upon the specific request. You can do this by for example hard coding them in at progam start and setting the entitie's values with the data or you can use a JSON Parser which will gnerate the class directly form a JSON File. There are many ways to achive this. These objects which represent the given entities and return the correct one depending on the ID of the request (*the object data will be written directly to the HTTP response as JSON* as stated [here](https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service#_create_a_resource_controller)).

**YOU MUST NOT hardcode the JSON responses as strings, our testsystem will detect this!**
**YOU WILL GET 0 POINTS AND WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE COURSE (only de-registered and NOT graded)**
Implementing this correctly now will save you a lot of time later on.

For testing you can use API request analysers like:
- [Insomnia](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
- [PortSwinger](https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload)



### Request `Get /amenities (6P)`

This request should return all information about all 5 amenities from [A0_ENTITIES](samples/A0_ENTITIES.md). Additionally, you have to add information on paging to achieve the correct return format.  

You shall implement the request including all parameters as listed below (you do not need to take care of any logic behind them, but you must get error handling right, especially when thinking about possible parameter combinations).

**Parameters** *(either group* `bbox.*` *or* `point.*` *are mandatory or the request is invalid!):*

- `amenity`: optional, can specify the type of amenity to return, if empty: return all types
- `bbox.tl.x`, `bbox.tl.y`: top-left of the bounding box to search for
- `bbox.br.x`, `bbox.br.y`: bottom-right of the bounding box to search for
- `point.x`, `point.y`: center of the point  
- `point.d`: maximum distance to the point, in meters 
- `take` (default: 50) optional parameter for paping, take is the limit.
- `skip` (default: 0): optional parameter for paging,skip is how many you need to step over.

 you have to handle errors (like out of bounds), but you do not have to implement the parameters for A0, so you still have to add them to with `@RequestParam`.

**Return format**: see [A0_RESPONSES](samples/A0_RESPONSES.md)

### Request `Get /amenities/{id} (4P)`

This request should return all information about a single point of interest based on its ID. This also includes the GeoJSON representation.

**Parameters:** *None*

**Return format**: see [A0_RESPONSES](samples/A0_RESPONSES.md)

### Request `Get /roads (4P)`

This request should return all information about all 5 roads from [A0_ENTITIES](samples/A0_ENTITIES.md). Additionally, you have to add information on paging to achieve the correct return format. 

You shall implement the request including all parameters as listed below (you do not need to take care of any logic behind them, but you must get error handling right).

**Parameters:**

- `road`: optional, can specify the type of road to return, if empty: return all types
- `bbox.tl.x`, `bbox.tl.y`: top-left of the bounding box to search for 
- `bbox.br.x`, `bbox.br.y`: bottom-right of the bounding box to search for 
- `take` (default: 50) optional parameter for paging, take is the limit.
- `skip` (default: 0): optional parameter for paging, skip is how many you need to step over. 

 you have to handle errors (like out of bounds), but you do not have to implement the parameters for A0, so you still have to add them to with `@RequestParam`. 

**Return format**: see [A0_RESPONSES](samples/A0_RESPONSES.md)

### Request `Get /roads/{id} (4P)`

This request should return all information that you can find about the road given by the ID. This includes some computed statistics like child ID's and the full GeoJSON representation.

**Parameters:** *None*

**Return format**: see [A0_RESPONSES](samples/A0_RESPONSES.md)

## Error Handling (7P)

In this assignment, you will implement error handling for your API to ensure robustness and clarity for the client. Consider these key points:

If an error occurs, you should return a simple error response in the Spring Boot service as JSON, following the guidelines outlined in [responses](samples/A0_RESPONSES.md). The JSON response should indicate the error encountered, and most importantly the appropriate status code should be set. Choose a message that helps **you** with debugging.

Use the following status codes for the respective errors:

* `400` **Bad Request**: For missing or invalid parameters or invalid combinations of parameters.
* `404` **Not Found:** If the entity requested could not be found.

**Check for invalid inputs:**
Parameters such as IDs and coordinates must have valid values. Use exceptions for scenarios like negative IDs or invalid bounding boxes. Look at the osm data and [responses](samples/A0_RESPONSES.md). Do Longitude and Latitude makes sense with every value for a bounding box? ;)

For error handling, you will need to create a mechanism to properly manage invalid requests and unexpected issues within your API. Spring Boot offers several built-in ways to handle exceptions globally, making your code cleaner and more maintainable.

**Key things to check for:**
- Invalid or missing parameters (such as bounding box coordinates or IDs).
- Correct argument types for each request.
- Handle cases where resources (like amenities or roads) are not found.

**Suggested approach:**
- **Exception Handler Class:** Use a `@ControllerAdvice` class to globally catch exceptions like NotFoundException. You can return meaningful HTTP status codes like 404 Not Found or 400 Bad Request with error messages.
- **Response Structure:** Implement a custom error response model that includes relevant details (e.g., message, status). This makes it easy for you to interpret what went wrong. The message is for you only we do not test the message in the testsystem, but please make it readable or we will not be able to help you ...

```java
// include all your exception classes ...


// this is just a basic template, you can do it in many diffrent ways
@ControllerAdvice
public class your_exception_controller {

    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)
    @ExceptionHandler(SomeException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> errorHandlerfunc(SomeException exception) {
        return "return the correct response entity with the Http status";
    }

    // More handlers for different exceptions
}
```
