# Assignment A1
# Timeline
+ Start: 4.11.2024 
+ Soft-Deadline: 19.12.2024
+ Tests for Tasks of A1 will not be continued after Soft-Deadline. Check the Discord announcements here how this will be decided exactly!

# Assignment Overview
In A1 you will continue to build the core of the service. In these tasks, you will implement the usage of the dataset, connect the Middleware with the Backend, and return entities based on various requests. Additionally you will further expand the Error Handling of the service. There are many ways to complete this assignment. There is no style guide or coding guidelines, but please make your code as readable as possible! Do not forget the MapLogger functions!  

While you can still work on this Assignment after the Soft-Deadline, you will no longer get Feedback from the Test System. After the Soft Deadline, only the tests for tasks of A2 will continue to give Feedback. Again, check the Discord announcements here how this will be decided exactly!

You will now no longer work alone, this means teamwork is the key. Be respectful to your teammates and do your part of the work. **The workload should be distributed equally!** If you did not contribute enough to the assignment, you might get massive deductions! You should not only be able to explain your part, but also the code of your teammates.

## Architecture  

The project consists of three main components: the Frontend, Middleware, and Backend. The architecture should already be familiar from A0, just now with some minor changes. Each layer has a distinct role in the application's functionality, ensuring a smooth flow of data between the user and the system. Below is a breakdown of these components.The architecture of the project consists of the following parts:

![image.png](samples/architecture.png)
  

### Frontend:
**Purpose**: The Frontend is the user-facing part of the application, already provided to you. Technology: It is written in HTML.

**Role**:  

- This is where users interact with the service.

- Gathers inputs from the user, such as map coordinates or routing requests, and sends them to the Middleware.

- The Frontend also displays the results returned by the system and in later assignments you will also see an interactive map of the data, but you don't have to change anything, its purely for visualization of your results.

- Do NOT modify this file unless you ask us first!

### Middleware

**Purpose**: Acts as the bridge between the Frontend and Backend.  
**Technology**: Implemented using Java Spring (Spring Boot).
**Role**:
- **Request Processing**: When the Frontend sends a request (e.g., for route calculation or fetching map data), the Middleware processes it.
- **Validation and Error Handling**: Ensures the request is valid, and if not, generates appropriate error messages.
- **Data Preparation**: Can perform additional processing on the data (e.g., filtering, transforming) before forwarding it to the Backend.

  
The Middleware simplifies communication between the Frontend and Backend by handling complex tasks like input validation, and ensuring that requests are appropriately routed. So the Middleware acts as a middleman, ensuring that requests from the user are properly checked and formatted before being sent to the Backend. The Middleware gets the data **ON DEMAND** from the Backend (!!)  

### Backend
**Purpose**: Core data processing layer.
**Role**:
- This is where the actual map data (roads, amenities, land usage) is stored and managed.
- The backend receives requests from the middleware, processes them (e.g., querying, calculating routes), and sends back the correct data to the middleware for user display. Also the backend is a server implemented using Java Classes.

In the backend the core processing occurs. It interacts directly with the given dataset and saves the described objects.

Here the requests from the middleware are being received, handled and the correct data is sent back to the middleware.  

### RESTful API

A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) allows you to expose resources (like roads, points of interest, or tiles in this case) via endpoints. Each resource can be accessed or manipulated using standard HTTP methods like:

```
GET to retrieve resources,
POST to create new resources,
PUT to update resources,
DELETE to remove resources.
```
In simple terms, a RESTful API is like a waiter at a restaurant, taking your request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and bringing you back the data or changes you've asked for. In the assignments you will implement several GET requests that respond with data representing roads and amenities. These requests should follow REST principles, meaning they are stateless, and each URL (endpoint) represents a specific resource. You do not have to implement the other request types for A1 and A2.


## Roadmap after A0:

In A0 you have already implemented the basics of your RESTful API using the Spring Boot REST framework for the mapping service. Take the A0 solution of your team member with the highest points and add it to your team project. It is important that your startup functions for the Backend and the Middleware still work and you extend your error handling structure. In A2 you will create more complex requests and actually display the data of the map!

### 1. Parse the Dataset - Open Street Map (OSM)  
Data Source: The project uses a filtered subset of OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. (can be found in the Teach Center)

Format: The dataset is in XML format, with unnecessary entries filtered out to focus on the roads, amenities, and land usage within Graz and surrounding areas.

**Processing**:
- You'll interact with this dataset primarily in the backend.
- Parsing OSM data can be complex, but you’re provided with the [JTS](https://github.com/locationtech/jts/tree/master) (Java Topology Suite), a popular geospatial library in Java. We highly recommend using it to handle the geometric and spatial data efficiently. See also the fifth KU session for more insights to JTS.  

In A1 this will be one of the main tasks, further explanations can be found in the task "Data Loading" and the fifth and sixth KU session. Slides are already available in Teach Center.
  

### 2. Middleware and Backend Communication  

Now that you have already set up the basic REST API in A0, you will now connect this API to your Backend that retrieves real data from [Open Street Map (OSM)](https://tc.tugraz.at/main/mod/resource/view.php?id=378614).  You will implement [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) into your service to enable communication between the Middleware and the Backend, allowing the Middleware to request actual map and geospatial data which has been processed and stored in the Backend. You MUST move the data on demand! Do not just copy everything at once to the Middleware, only the requested data. This will otherwise lead to timeouts or out-of-memory errors (RAM should stay below 3 GB), leading to zero points on the test system!  

### 3. Complete the Spring Boot REST Framework Implementation  

Spring Boot is a Java-based framework that simplifies the creation of production-ready applications. The Spring Boot REST framework provides an easy way to build RESTful services. With it, you can quickly set up an API, define endpoints, and handle requests and responses.  

In A0 you have already implemented the basic set of REST endpoints for handling requests related to amenities and roads. Now instead of returning placeholder data for amenities and roads, you will actually get/retrieve the data from the Open Street Map Data from the Backend and expand your error handling.  

### 4. Extend the Error handling of your service  

Make sure the error handling of A0 now works with your service and extend your error handling cases also with the errors which can be encountered in the Backend. (Status `500`).
  

### 5. The next assignments

After you have completed all tasks of A1 you can move on to [A2](A2.md) and/or [BONUS](BONUS.md). (The assignment descriptions will be released at a later point, make sure you can **pull from upstream**). We highly recommend that you first correctly implement all tasks in A1 because it is the foundation of A2 where you will expand your service with more requests, but theoretically you can just parse the Dataset correctly and establish communication between your Backend and Middleware and move on to the more complex requests.
It is again up to you how you want to solve this. 
  The BONUS assignment will cover an introduction to simple 2D Java GPU Rendering using [LWJGL](https://www.lwjgl.org/). The BONUS does not depend on A1 or A2.

# Tasks
Below you can find the description of all tasks you need to implement in Assignment 1.
We recommend to start with the tasks chronologically, from top to bottom.
  

## Data Loading

In this task you will load the provided Dataset from the OSM (OpenStreetMap) file. You can download it from the [TeachCenter](https://tc.tugraz.at/main/mod/resource/view.php?id=378614). For those using PCs with lower processing power, a smaller version of the OSM file ([graz_tiny_reduced](https://tc.tugraz.at/main/mod/resource/view.php?id=382292)) is also available to ensure smooth performance. Put it into the corresponding directory `/data` in your project.

**!!! DO NOT COMMIT AND PUSH THE OSM FILE(S) !!!**
![](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270897493/figure/fig2/AS:669688925286401@1536677690183/Example-of-OSM-file-export-from-architectural-barriers-survey-database-ready-for-editing.png)

The objective is to extract and process data from this file, focusing on the `node`, `way`, and `relation` elements. Here is our recommendation on how you should approach the task:

  

#### 1. Loading Nodes (`node`)

+ Begin by loading all the nodes from the OSM file.
+ Each node's coordinates should be recorded, with the Longitude representing the X-Coordinate and the Latitude representing the Y-Coordinate.
+ Store the tags associated with each node in a HashMap, where `k` is the key and `v` is the value of the tag for example.

  
#### 2. Loading Ways (`way`)

+ Next, load the way elements, which are made up of multiple nodes.
+ These ways can describe both amenities and roads
+ Each way contains references to nodes that must be resolved to construct LineStrings.
+ If a way is closed (i.e., it forms a loop) and consists of more than two points, it should be converted into a Polygon.
+ The tags for each way should be stored similarly to the nodes, using a hashmap.
+ If you do not find a node that is referenced by a way, you can just ignore it
  

#### 3. Loading Relations (`relation`)
 
+ Relations require special handling, particularly when dealing with multi-polygon relations.
+ For this, refer to the [OpenStreetMap documentation](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Relation:multipolygon) for examples of edge cases. (There is also some helpful documentation linked in the fifth and sixth KU session)
+ To make it easier for you we provide you with a recommendation in form of a pseudo-code (This is Pseudo-Python code and NOT Java Code, do NOT just copy this into your repository !!)  to manage the geometries of relations:
 

```python
def  buildGeom(members:list, tags: dict{str,str}) -> GeometryCollection:
	if  "multipolygon"  in tags:
		multi_polygons = []
		inners = []
		outer = None

		for(i = 0; i < members.lenghth;) :
			closed_circle = getNextClosed(i, members)
			# this iterates over the next members and returns a polygon
			# if it is able to find a combination of coordinated in the next
			# (one or more) *same* role-types,
			# i.e. a closed ring of only outer or inner line segments

			if closed_circle:
				if closed_circle.last_role == "outer":
					if outer:
						multi_polygons += [buildMultipolygon([outer, ..., inners])] # multipolygons usually have the first ring as the outer one
					outer = closed_circle.polygon	

				elif closed_circle.last_role == "inner":
						inners += [closed_circle.polygon]
				i = closed_circle.last_member_idx + 1
			else
				raise error

		# if there is still a an outer ring pick it up and add it
		if outer:
			multi_polygons += [buildMultipolygon([outer, ...inners])]
			return buildGeometrycollection(multi_polygons)
	else:
		return buildGeometrycollection(members)
		# just multiple geometries
```  

Please note that the following tasks are highly dependent on this task, so make sure to properly implement the loading phase. Make sure that the loading is complete in about 5 seconds. You are allowed to shut the Backend down if the XML is malformed or not present. You are free to use any XML-parser of your choice. 
For more information on XML parsers, check out the sixth KU session and slides.
Also, you are allowed to use your own custom parser, but this is not recommended. Ask us before you want to use any other parser besides the DOM/SAX parser and state which dependencies you would need.

We recommend using the Java-Extension package (`javax.xml.parsers.*`).

For information on how to interact with JTS see [examples](https://github.com/locationtech/jts/blob/master/modules/example/src/main/java/org/locationtech/jtsexample/geom/BasicExample.java) or the [documentation](https://locationtech.github.io/jts/javadoc/). Otherwise, there will be more discussion in the fifth and sixth KU session, slides are, as said, already available, in case you want to start early.
  

#### Using the DOM Parser

The DOM Parser is one of the tools you could use from the `javax.xml.parsers.\*`. The DOM (Document Object Model) parser is a tree-based API that loads the entire XML document into memory and parses it as a tree of nodes. This makes it easy to navigate and manipulate the XML data, which can be helpful when working with datasets like amenities or other geographical data.

  ![](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java_xml/images/dom_parser.jpg)

1. Import necessary libraries:

The key classes required to work with the DOM parser in Java are from the javax.xml.parsers package.  

```java
import javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder;
import javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory;
import org.w3c.dom.Document;
import org.w3c.dom.NodeList;
import org.w3c.dom.Element;
```

2. Read and parse the XML file:
Use DocumentBuilderFactory and DocumentBuilder to load the OSM file into memory and parse it as a DOM tree. (You might need to adapt the following lines a bit depending on your approach)

  
```java
DocumentBuilderFactory  factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
DocumentBuilder  builder = factory.newDocumentBuilder();
Document  document = builder.parse(new  File("dataset.osm"));
document.getDocumentElement().normalize();
```

3. Access elements and nodes:  
Use getElementsByTagName() to retrieve elements or navigate the tree using methods like getChildNodes() or getAttribute().

4. Extract data:
Each element can be accessed by its tag name or attribute, allowing you to extract the necessary data to process or load into your application.

  
```java
String  elementName = element.getElementsByTagName("name").item(0).getTextContent();
String  latitude = element.getAttribute("lat");
String  longitude = element.getAttribute("lon");
```

After you have finally correctly loaded all the nodes, ways and relations you have to log the amount of nodes and ways using the specific methods of the MapLogger class (**DON'T modify the MapLogger class !!**)  

```py
/**
* Log in the Backend after finishing loading all the nodes (this should not take longer than 5 seconds!) and log
* the amount of types *not* referenced by other entities!
*
* @param nodes
* @param ways
* @param relations
*/
```

---
#### Using the SAX Parser

The SAX (Simple API for XML) parser is an alternative to the DOM parser, also available from the `javax.xml.parsers.*` package. Unlike DOM, SAX is an event-driven parser that processes XML data as a stream, without loading the entire document into memory. This makes it more memory-efficient, especially for large files, though it can be more complex to navigate and manipulate data with SAX. 

(Note: Both options work perfectly fine if done efficiently, also no need for any multi-threading in either option)

![](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java_xml/images/sax_parser.jpg)

1. Import necessary libraries:

The key classes required to work with the SAX parser in Java are from the `javax.xml.parsers` and `org.xml.sax` packages.

```java
import javax.xml.parsers.SAXParser;
import javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory;
import org.xml.sax.Attributes;
import org.xml.sax.SAXException;
import org.xml.sax.helpers.DefaultHandler;
```

2. Set up and parse the XML file:

Use `SAXParserFactory` and `SAXParser` to process the OSM file as a stream of events, triggering methods on each XML element.

```java
SAXParserFactory factory = SAXParserFactory.newInstance();
SAXParser parser = factory.newSAXParser();
File inputFile = new File("dataset.osm");
parser.parse(inputFile, new DefaultHandler() {
    @Override
    public void startElement(String uri, String localName, String qName, Attributes attributes) throws SAXException {
        // Logic for processing elements as they are encountered
    }
});
```

3. Access elements and attributes:

In SAX, elements and attributes are processed as they are encountered. The `startElement()` method is called when a new tag begins, allowing you to capture data on the fly. `Attributes` provides access to the element’s attributes.

```java
@Override
public void startElement(String uri, String localName, String qName, Attributes attributes) throws SAXException {
    if ("node".equals(qName)) {
        String latitude = attributes.getValue("lat");
        String longitude = attributes.getValue("lon");
        String elementName = attributes.getValue("name");  // Depending on structure, this might vary
    }
}
```

4. Extract data:

In the SAX parser, data extraction typically happens within the `startElement()` and `endElement()` methods, where you can retrieve attribute values and prepare data for your application.

5. Log the result:

After parsing, ensure to log the count of nodes, ways, and relations using the `MapLogger` class, without modifying it.

  

## Communication with the Backend
 
In this subtask, you'll focus on ensuring that the Backend and Middleware can communicate properly, which is essential for the application to function. We recommend using [gRPC (This is also a tutorial link)](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/), as it’s already integrated into the shared subproject and will be covered in the lecture. However, you are free to choose any communication method—whether it’s a RESTful service, plain Java Sockets, or another approach—as long as it operates within the provided Docker Compose setup. While there are no additional points for this task, establishing a robust communication system is essential for completing all subsequent tasks. We encourage you to design the communication between systems in a way that best fits your project.
For reference: gRPC worked the best here and only a very small number of groups (< 5) has had a successful alternative until now. Take this information however with a grain of salt.
For gRPC there also is again a tutorial session and example code given - see the fourth session from TC, slides and the sample Java code  are also already available.
  

### What is gRPC?

gRPC (gRPC Remote Procedure Call) is a high-performance, open-source RPC framework that enables communication between services across different platforms. It uses Protocol Buffers (`.proto`) as the interface definition language and can be highly efficient in terms of both speed and data size, compared to traditional REST APIs. For working with the `.proto` files, use `mvn clean install` which generates the code stubs specified.

  ![](https://techdozo.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/grpc-Server-Streaming.drawio.png.webp)

### Why Use gRPC?

- High performance: gRPC is faster and more efficient in handling large-scale service-to-service communication.
- Widely used
- Language-agnostic: Clients and servers can be written in different languages.
- Streaming capabilities: gRPC supports both client and server-side streaming.
- Code generation: Based on .proto files, gRPC generates both client and server code, simplifying development.

### General gRPC Workflow

In a typical gRPC call, the following steps take place.

1.  It all starts with a client workflow initiating an RPC call.
2.  Once RPC starts, the client stub encodes the message in binary format. And, then it creates an **HTTP POST request** with the encoded message.
3.  Afterwards, the encoded message is sent over the channel. A gRPC channel provides a connection to a gRPC server on a specified host and port.
4.  On the server side, the server hands over the encoded message to the auto-generated server stub.
5.  After receiving the message, the server stub deserializes the message into a language-specific data structure.
6.  And finally, the server stub calls the overridden service method and passes the parsed message.

Similarly, on the round trip, the response from the server is encoded and sent back to the client.

![](https://techdozo.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/grpc-communication-1024x493.png.webp)

### 1. Setup

Implement the server and client architecture of gRPC by for example creating a server-class in the backend and a client-class in the middleware.
  

```java
// before you start your data loading process in the MapServiceServer class in the Backend.
// use io.grpc.Server and io.grpc.ServerBuilder for example to create the server class.

Your_gRPC_Server_Class  server = new  Your_gRPC_Server_Class(port);
```

```java
// before you start the SpringBootApplication in the MapApplication class in the Middleware.
// use mapper.MapperServiceGrpc.* and io.grpc.ManagedChannelbuilder for example to create the client class.

Your_gRPC_Client_Class.setTheBackendPortTarget(backend_target);
```  

### 2. Spring Boot Application

The Spring Boot app provides the RESTful API that interacts with the client. The core responsibility of this application is to receive HTTP requests, forward them to the gRPC client, and return the response from the Backend to the REST client.

```java
// in each of your @GetMapping functions in the @RestController
String  response = Your_gRPC_Client_Class.yourRequestToTheBackend(args, ...);
return  "The Response and HTTP Status"
```


### 3. gRPC Client
The gRPCClient class handles communication with the gRPC backend service. It is responsible for sending structured requests and receiving responses defined by the .proto file.

```java
// can be implemented in many diffrent ways...
public  class  gRPCClient { 
	public  String  getResponse(string  arg1, string  arg2, ...) {
		// Building the gRPC request

		ArgRequest  request = ArgRequest.newBuilder()
					.setArg1(arg1)
					.setArg2(arg2)
					...
					.build();
 
		// Sending request to gRPC server
		DependsOnYourImplementation  response = blockingStub.getResponse(request);
		return  response.getJson();
	}
}
```  

### 4. gRPC Server (Backend)

The gRPC backend service receives requests from the Spring Boot Middleware, processes them, and returns the requested amenities data.

### 5. gRPC Proto File

The `.proto` file defines the structure of the gRPC messages and the services. Your entries in the `.proto` file will look similar to this:  

```proto
syntax = "proto3";
 
message AmenitiesRequest {
	string amenity = 1;
	optional ... = 2;
	...
}
```
For the `.proto` file also check out the fourth tutorial session and the example code from TC.
In the `.proto` file, as you can see, each field in the message definition has a unique numbered tag. These tags are used to identify your fields in the message binary format, and should not be changed once your message type is in use. The numbered tags are used to match fields when serializing and deserializing the data. If you are curious to see if the order matters, read [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26826421/protocol-buffers-unique-numbered-tag-clarification). And if you *really* want to know how protobuf encodes your messages, you can read [this](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/encoding/).
  

### How It All Comes Together
  
1. Client requests amenities through the REST API (MapController).
2. Spring Boot forwards the request to the gRPC client.
3. The gRPC client sends a structured request to the gRPC backend.
4. The gRPC backend processes the request, retrieves the data, and sends a JSON response.
5. The gRPC client returns the data to the Spring Boot API, which sends the response back to the client.


## Amenity & Road requests
  
For the Amenity and Road requests the geometric boundaries should be determined by intersecting the appropriate shapes using the JTS package. The distance should be calculated by transforming all possible targets and the query from `EPSG:4326` to `EPSG:31256`. Afterwards you simply can call `.distance(other)` on the geometry to determine and threshold the distance. See [this document](https://github.com/geotools/geotools/blob/main/docs/user/library/referencing/crs.rst) for more information. Nevertheless, this is the snippet you can use directly (please create the transform only once):
  

```java
CoordinateReferenceSystem  sourceCRS = CRS.decode("EPSG:4326");
CoordinateReferenceSystem  targetCRS = CRS.decode("EPSG:31256");
MathTransform  transform = CRS.findMathTransform(sourceCRS, targetCRS, true);
...
var  geometryLocal = geometry.transform(transform);
```

Create classes which hold the needed data and convert them into JSON and the GeoJSON format. For the conversion to a string you can use a ObjectMapper for example.

## Request Get /amenities/{id}

Different from the implementation from A0 this request should now access the whole dataset and return all information about a single point of interest based on its ID. This also includes the GeoJSON representation.

Parameters: None  

*Return format*: see [responses](samples/RESPONSES.md)  

## Request Get /roads/{id}  

Different from the implementation from A0 this request should now also access the dataset and return all information that you can find about the road given by the ID. This includes some computed statistics like child ID's and the full GeoJSON representation.

Parameters: None
  
*Return format*: see [responses](samples/RESPONSES.md)

  
## Request: GET /amenities  

This request returns points of interest (POIs) of a specified type (e.g., restaurants, parks) within a defined area or near a specific point.
The user can filter the POIs using either a bounding box or a point with a radius.

  
Parameters (either group bbox.\* and point.\* are queried!):  

+  `amenity`: optional, can specify the type of amenity to return, if empty: return all types
+  `bbox.tl.x`,`bbox.tl.y`: top-left of the bounding box to search for
+  `bbox.br.x`,`bbox.br.y`: bottom-right of the bounding box to search for
+  `point.x`,`point.y`: center of the point
+  `point.d`: maximum distance to the point, in meters
+ optional paging parameters
	+  `take`: Limit of results per page. Default value: 50 (This needs to be implemented now in A1)
	+  `skip`: Amount of results to step over. Default value: 0 (This needs to be implemented now in A1)
  
The response includes a list of POIs that match the search criteria, along with paging information.

Each POI entry contains details such as the name, its geometry information (in GeoJSON format), and various tags describing the amenity (for the exact format see [responses](samples/RESPONSES.md)).
  
The response also includes pagination information, indicating how many results are returned, skipped, and the total number of results.

Please note that all x/y inputs have to be within the latitude/longitude bounds specified. Furthermore, sort the results by their respective ID's you find in the CSVs. This is required to keep paging consistent.
  

*Return format*: see [responses](samples/RESPONSES.md)

## Request: GET /roads

This request returns roads within a specified area, similar to the POI request above. 
In addition to finding roads fully contained within the bounding box, this endpoint can also identify roads that intersect with the bounding box at any edge.

Please note that we are using the word road for all entities that have the tag highway.

Parameters:  
+  `road`: optional, can specify the type of road to return, if empty: return all types
+  `bbox.tl.x`,`bbox.tl.y`: top-left of the bounding box to search for
+  `bbox.br.x`,`bbox.br.y`: bottom-right of the bounding box to search for
+ optional paging parameters
	+  `take`: Limit of results per page. Default value: 50 (This needs to be implemented now in A1)
	+  `skip`: Amount of results to step over. Default value: 0 (This needs to be implemented now in A1)

The response includes a list of roads that match the search criteria, with details such as the road ID, type, name, and geometry (for the exact format see [responses](samples/RESPONSES.md)).

Geometries are provided in the GeoJSON format, allowing for easy integration with mapping tools.
The response also includes pagination information, indicating how many results are returned, skipped, and the total number of results.

Please note that all x/y inputs have to be within the latitude/longitude bounds specified. Furthermore, sort the results by their respective ID's you find in the CSVs. This is required to keep paging consistent.
  
*Return format*: see [responses](samples/RESPONSES.md)
  

## **Error Handling**

After parsing the dataset, adding the connection between Backend and Middleware and implementing amenity- and road-requests in A1 a lot of things could go wrong when using the service. The dataset-file might not be present, the Backend could not be reachable for the Middleware etc.

For these cases you will need to expand the implemented Error Handling of A0 and return error codes in various places to correctly handle everything that could go wrong. Consider these key points:

If an error occurs, you should return a simple error response in the Spring Boot service as JSON, following the guidelines outlined in [responses](samples/RESPONSES.md). The JSON response should indicate the error encountered, and most importantly the appropriate status code should be set. Choose a message that helps **you** with debugging.

Use the following status codes for the respective errors:

*  `400`  **Bad Request**: For missing or invalid parameters or invalid combinations of parameters.
*  `500`  **Internal Server Error**: for any internal issues, i.e. cannot reach the Backend.
*  `404`  **Not Found:** If the entity requested could not be found.

**Check for invalid inputs:**

Parameters such as IDs and coordinates must have valid values. Use exceptions for scenarios like negative IDs or invalid bounding boxes. Look at the osm data and [responses](samples/RESPONSES.md). Do Longitude and Latitude makes sense with every value for a bounding box? ;)

In general, bounding boxes typically represent rectangular areas on a 2D map using latitude and longitude. The bounds you should set must ensure that all coordinates fall within valid latitude and longitude ranges (-90 to 90 for latitude and -180 to 180 for longitude). These ranges make sense since:  

- Latitude (-90 to 90) covers the distance from the South Pole to the North Pole.
- Longitude (-180 to 180) spans the full horizontal range around the Earth, where 180°E is the same line as 180°W, making them wrap around at the International Date Line.

  ![This Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/FedStats_Lat_long.svg)

For error handling, you will need to create a mechanism to properly manage invalid requests and unexpected issues within your API. Spring Boot offers several built-in ways to handle exceptions globally, making your code cleaner and more maintainable. An example can be seen below, but there are many ways to do this.

  

Key things to check for:

- Invalid or missing parameters (such as bounding box coordinates or negative or non existing ID).
- Correct argument types for each request.
- Handle cases where resources (like amenities or roads) are not found.

Suggested approach:

- Exception Handler Class: Use a @ControllerAdvice class to globally catch exceptions like NotFoundException. You can return meaningful HTTP status codes like 404 Not Found or 400 Bad Request with error messages.

- Response Structure: Implement a custom error response model that includes relevant details (e.g., message, status). This makes it easy for you to interpret what went wrong. The message is for you only we do not test the message in the testsystem, but please make it readable or we will not be able to help you ...

```java
// include all your exception classes ...
// this is just a basic template, you can do it in many diffrent ways

@ControllerAdvice
public  class  your_exception_controller {  
	@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND) // This is the HTTP Error Code
	@ExceptionHandler(SomeException.class) // This is your custom class which for example extends the "RunTimeException"
	
	// You NEED the annotations !!!
	public  ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> errorHandlerfunc(SomeException  exception) {
		return  "return the correct response entity with the Http status";
	}

	// More handlers for different exceptions
	// If you did well in A0, there is not much to do here ;)
}
```

# **Tips and Tools:**

-  **[JSON Diff](https://www.jsondiff.com/)**, with this tool you can easily compare two JSON files.
- Use the debug MapLogger function in your code. Do NOT add custom methods to the MapLogger!
- Use **Insomnia** and test your responses locally!.
* When using the Java DOM parser `javax.xml.*` you may want to **access the length of child notes only once and save it in a variable** as we are not restructuring the XML - your data loading might slow down significantly otherwise!
* Please note that you have to move the data to the Middleware **on-demand**! You are not allowed to transfer all the data!
* The request are also paged - so there is (default) information on how many entities to return for each call!
* Note that you can use hashmaps for quick ID lookups ($\mathcal{O}(log(N)$) instead of $\mathcal{O}(N)$!)
* It is advisable that you already reformat the data from the different OSM types to either roads or amenities in the Backend, simplifying your gRPC structure a lot (you are free to also transform in the Middleware, just note that you have to build some kind of abstraction in gRPC for that!)
* OSM ways and nodes do **not** correspond to roads and nodes - amenities can be ways too (and vice-versa) (as an amenity could be e.g. a closed way to indicate the building outline)
* All relations should be at least tried to be built (and succeed, there are **no** invalid ones!)
* To keep paging consistent, sort the results by their ID in ascending order!
* Read the `MapLogger.java`'s method description **thoroughly** - log all events that might happen, you should use all methods in the end (even those from A0 in A1!)!
* Try to keep below ~3GB RAM consumption and load data within ~10 seconds, you will run into timeouts otherwise!
* Consider using proper exception as outlined in [this tutorial](https://www.baeldung.com/exception-handling-for-rest-with-spring), this cleans things up -`@ControllerAdvice` is the nicest solution! (This should be pretty much the same as in A0)
*  **Use** the environment variables we provide to connect to the Backend and load the XML file!
* Start early and communicate well in your team! At the assignment reviews everyone in the team should be able to explain, test and extend the project, regardless of who did which part!
* DO NOT PLAGIARIZE OR USE AN LLM TO AN EXTENT, WHERE IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE PLAGIARIZED! PLAGIARISM IS NOT A JOKE: [SEE HERE](https://www.tugraz.at/fileadmin/public/Studierende_und_Bedienstete/Satzung_und_Geschaeftsordnungen_der_TU_Graz/Satzungsteil_Plagiat.pdf)
